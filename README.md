A Windows application that enforces daily screen time limits by locking the workstation when the configured usage time is reached. Ideal for productivity, parental controls, or self-discipline.

## Features

- ‚è≥ **Daily Time Tracking**: Resets usage counter at midnight
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Limits**: Set daily time limits, warning thresholds, and idle detection
- üïí **Grace Period**: Allows emergency usage after limit is reached
- ‚è∞ **Warnings**: Notifies user as limit approaches
- üîí **Auto-Lock**: Locks workstation when time expires
- üö´ **Single Instance**: Ensures only one copy runs at a time

## How It Works

The program:
1. Tracks active computer usage time (ignores idle periods)
2. Saves daily usage to a data file
3. Shows warnings when approaching the limit
4. Grants a configurable grace period when first exceeding limits
5. Locks the workstation when the grace period expires

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Place `screen_time_restrictor.exe` in your preferred directory
3. A `config.ini` file will be automatically created on first run

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to customize:

```ini
[Settings]
TimeLimitSeconds=10800       # Daily limit in seconds (3 hour)
WarningTimeSeconds=300       # Warn when this many seconds remain (5 mins)
LoginGracePeriodSeconds=600  #  Emergency usage time after limit (10 mins)
```
